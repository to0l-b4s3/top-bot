go through the pics and compare how the current bot responds (current-response images) and how i expect it to respond (expectations images)
also go through the files and folders in this directory so that you get the hang how it's done
apply the same method on the rest of the commands
even commands with args and flags, introduce a follow-up kinda structure through :

Interactive UI Messages
- Buttons Message
- List Message
- Interactive Message (Template Buttons)
- Footer Text
- ContactCards
